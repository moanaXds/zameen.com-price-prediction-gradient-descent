# zameen.com Price Prediction — Gradient Descent from scratch

This project predicts real-estate prices using a custom implementation of **Linear Regression trained with Gradient Descent**, without relying on scikit-learn.  
It demonstrates data cleaning, feature normalization, training, and evaluation using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
